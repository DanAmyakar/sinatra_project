Run 'bundle'

To launch the 'thin' server on windows...
Use this command in the terminal: 'rerun --dir app -- thin start --port=9494 -R config.ru' and vist 'localhost:9494' in a browser. 
the 'rerun' gem is similar to 'shotgun' but for windows.

Other wise you can use shotgun for you mac users and vist 'localhost:9393'
